# React useReducer Course Project

This project is part of the **React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)** course on Udemy. It focuses on learning and implementing the **React Context API** and **useReducer** hook to manage state effectively in React applications.

## Course Information

- **Course Name**: [React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/8244656#overview)
- **Instructor**: Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller
- **Section**: Context API and useReducer

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- How to use the **React Context API** to manage global state.
- How to implement the **useReducer** hook for state management.
- Best practices for combining Context API and useReducer in React applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) (The learner was using Node 22.13.0 at the time this project was downloaded from Academind's repo)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start dev
```

## Key Concepts Covered

- **React Context API**: Sharing state across components without prop drilling.
- **useReducer Hook**: Managing complex state logic in a predictable way.
- Combining Context API and useReducer for scalable state management.
